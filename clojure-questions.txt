clojure questions:
1. difference between let & def
	(apart of the one which:
		+ allows let "create" a new scope, where the same bind-name can be used)
		+ deconstruct the bind-name, using head-tail args
		+ aha, so many bind-names can be placed for binding name -> expression, separated by newline)

2. keys in a map, are functions??
	(def myMap {:foo "this is foo" :bar "this bar"})
	(println (:foo myMap))
